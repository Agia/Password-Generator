# Password Generator

## Description

[**View demo**](https://agia.github.io/Password-Generator/)

A browser-based password generator, that prompts the user for choices, and outputs a randomized password based on those choices.

Built using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS.

## Usage

 The live demo is hosted with Github Pages, and can be accessed by clicking [**here**](https://agia.github.io/Password-Generator/) (or the `View Demo` link found in the section above).

## Credits

Thanks directed, in perpetuity (at least in technology terms), to the documentation found on [MDN Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/javascript), which were incredibly helpful.

## Future Development

I would like to like to revisit this project in the future, with a mind to:

- overhauling the design (I'll take any opportunity to stretch and improve those CSS, HTML and user experience / design muscles)
- further honing in on validating the user input (using `typeof`, for example, to ensure user input is a number where expected)
- customizing prompts and alerts, in terms of positioning, default content and appearance, which should, metaphorically, exercise all three facets (JavaScript, HTML and CSS) of this project.

Since they were out of the scope for the assignment, I didn't want to over-complicate my initial submission. But I fully intend, and hope, to revisit this project and use it as a practice exercise in future to improve my skills.
